To the Editors of the Semantic Web Journal

Dear Editors,

Please find attached to this letter our submission entitled
"Components.js: Semantic Dependency Injection"
for the submission type of "Reports on tools and systems".
In this article, we discuss the open-source Components.js dependency injection framework for TypeScript/JavaScript that has existed for more than four years,
and is experiencing significant and increasing usage as core technology within other applications.

In particular, we discuss the Components.js framework, and how it differs from other dependency injection framework.
To assess the importance and impact of this system, we discuss its download and usage metrics, and analyze three real-world uses in depth.

We hope this article is a good fit for this journal.
Should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
We look forward to hearing back from you and thank you in advance
