      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>A common practise within object-oriented software,
is the use of <em>composition</em> to represent relationships between objects.
<em>Dependency Injection (DI)</em> is a popular technique to manage such compositions,
which loosely couples objects via minimal interfaces,
and wires these objects together at runtime based on declarative configuration files.
Configurations for existing DI frameworks typically only have local semantics,
which limits their usage in other contexts.
<!-- Need         -->
In some cases, such configurations are required outside of their local scope,
such as for the reproducibility of experiments, static program analysis, and semantic workflows.
As such, there is a need for globally interoperable, addressable, and discoverable configurations,
which can be achieved by leveraging the power of Linked Data.
<!-- Task         -->
To resolve this need, we introduce <em>Components.js</em>,
an open-source semantic DI framework for TypeScript and JavaScript applications
that gives global semantics to its Linked Data-based configuration files.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article, we report on the Components.js framework
by explaining its architecture and configuration,
and we discuss its impact by mentioning where and how it is being used in other applications.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show that Components.js is a stable framework that has seen significant uptake during the last couple of years.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
We recommend it to be used within software projects that require
high flexibility,
configuration without code changes,
sharing configurations with others,
or using these configurations in other contexts such as experimentation or static program analysis.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The ever-increasing complexity of the world will depend on highly flexible software to manage it,
for which frameworks such as Components.js will be crucial foundations.</p>

          <h2 property="schema:name">Introduction</h2>

          <p>Object-oriented (OO) programming is a highly popular paradigm within the domain of software engineering.
Considering <em>objects</em> containing data and logic as primary software elements
makes it easy for developers to understand software,
as it makes software resemble real-world mechanisms with interacting physical objects.
Most OO languages allow objects to be instantiated from <em>classes</em> that determine the object’s type,
where <em>inheritance</em> can be used to let classes extend from other classes,
and thereby inheriting their fields, methods, and type(s).
Unfortunately, inheritance is often overused in places where <em>composition</em> would be better suited <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>,
where composition of objects (containment within each other) leads to more flexibility in terms of object relationships,
and thereby leads to more loosely coupled objects.</p>

          <p>A popular technique to manage the composition of objects is called <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html"><em>Dependency Injection</em> (DI)</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
It assumes that objects are loosely coupled,
and that they only depend on each other via a minimal and generic interface,
without depending on concrete implementations of such interfaces.
In order to link these interfaces to concrete implementations,
a generic DI framework can provide specific implementations where needed based on some external configuration.
Since objects only communicate by strict interfaces,
and specific implementations are derived from an external configuration,
the specific wiring of a software application is not hard-coded anymore.
Instead, this wiring can be altered afterwards by modifying the configuration file,
which makes the application more flexible.</p>

          <p>Configurations for existing DI frameworks
are either defined directly within a programming language,
or are defined declaratively within text files with a domain-specific language using syntaxes such as JSON and XML.
The latter type of configuration files is better suited for use cases where no changes can be made to existing code –e.g., in the case of pre-compiled languages–,
when the creators of these configuration files have no programming knowledge,
or when configuration files are created automatically from an external tool –e.g., a visual drag-and-drop interface–.
Such declarative configuration files typically have only local semantics,
which means that they are usually only usable within the DI framework for which they were created, and for the current application only.
With the power of <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">Linked Data</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span> and the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/cours/essi2006/Scientific%20American_%20Feature%20Article_%20The%20Semantic%20Web_%20May%202001.pdf">Semantic Web</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span> in mind,
these configurations could move <em>beyond</em> their local scope,
and make them globally <em>interoperable</em>, <em>addressable</em>, and <em>discoverable</em>.</p>

          <p>To this end, we present <em>Components.js</em>,
a semantic DI framework for TypeScript and JavaScript applications
that gives global semantics to software configurations, hence surpassing existing dependency injection frameworks.
Components.js thereby enables highly modular applications to be built that are dynamically wired based on semantic configuration files.
The framework is open-source (<a href="https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components.js">https:/​/​github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components.js</a>),
available on npm (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/componentsjs">https:/​/​www.npmjs.com/package/componentsjs</a>),
and its complete documentation can be found at <a href="https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/">https:/​/​componentsjs.readthedocs.io/</a>.
Furthermore, it is being actively used as core technology within popular tools such as
the <a href="https://github.com/solid/community-server/" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​github.com/​solid/​community-​server/​">Solid Community Server</a> and <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://comunica.github.io/Article-ISWC2018-Resource/">Comunica</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>.
Within Components.js,
software configurations and modules are described as Linked Data using
the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority" href="https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/articles/describing-experiments/"><em>Object-Oriented Components vocabulary</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>
and the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority" href="https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/articles/describing-experiments/"><em>Object Mapping vocabulary</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>.
By publishing such descriptions,
the composition of software (and parts thereof) can be <em>unambiguously identified</em> by IRIs and 
retrieved through <em>dereferencing</em>.
Components.js automatically <em>instantiates</em> such software configurations, including resolving the necessary dependencies.
As such, this (de)referenceability of software configurations by IRI is beneficial in use cases such as:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Experimental research</dt>
            <dd>Providing the full provenance trail of used software configurations to produce experimental results and enable reproducibility.</dd>
            <dt>Static program analysis</dt>
            <dd>Discovering conflicts or compatibility issues of different classes within software using RDF tools such as SPARQL query engines and reasoners.</dd>
            <dt>Semantic workflows</dt>
            <dd>Automatic wiring of software using RDF tools to optimally address a specific need.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>In this article, we introduce the Components.js framework as follows.
In the next section (<a href="#related-work">Section 2</a>), we discuss the related work.
Next, in <a href="#configs">Section 3</a> we explain the declarative configuration files of Components.js,
followed by an architectural overview of the framework itself in <a href="#system">Section 4</a>.
Then, in <a href="#usage">Section 5</a>, we mention some applications where Components.js is being used.
Finally, we conclude in <a href="#conclusions">Section 6</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="related-work-di">Dependency Injection</h3>

          <p><strong>Inversion of Control</strong></p>

          <p><a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Inversion of Control (IoC)</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> is a general principle within software engineering
that inverts the usual flow of control within software architectures.
This is mostly done to reduce coupling between software components, and make the overall architecture more modular and extensible.
On the one hand, traditional procedural programming gives the developer direct control of the flow of logic, where code directly invokes other code.
IoC on the other hand implies the use of a framework that manages this flow,
and allows custom code –that is supplied by the developer–
to be invoked when the frameworks deems it necessary.
This concept is typically referred to as <em>“The Hollywood Principle: Don’t call us, we’ll call you”</em>.</p>

          <p>A specific technique to achieve IoC is <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html"><em>Dependency Injection</em> (DI)</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
As mentioned before, DI is based on the <em>composition</em> of objects to enable relationships between them (as opposed to <em>inheritance</em>).
These composed objects are tied to each other only by a lightweight interface,
where different implementations may be possible for each interface.
Using a DI framework, specific implementations for such interfaces can be configured,
after which they can be instantiated into objects,
and are injected into each other using the DI framework’s <em>assembler</em> to complete the wiring of the software application.</p>

          <p>The configuration of such a wiring of objects
can either be done in code, or via external configuration files.
The main motivations for configurations are the strict boundaries between configuration and logic,
enabling non-developers to configure the code,
and taking away the need to recompile the code for pre-compiled languages.
However, when dependencies are defined based on some logic such as external conditions,
configuration via code may be better suited,
as this can become too complex to define in declarative configuration files.</p>

          <p><strong>Forms of Injection</strong></p>

          <p>In practise, three main forms of DI exist through which dependencies can be injected into a an object:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Constructor injection</dt>
            <dd>Dependency objects are passed via a class constructor.</dd>
            <dt>Setter injection</dt>
            <dd>Dependencies are passed to an object by invoking setter methods.</dd>
            <dt>Interface injection</dt>
            <dd>The interface of dependencies expose a method that –when invoked– injects this dependency into an object that is passed to it. Such passed objects will typically a setter method for this.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>Constructor injection is the simplest and most popular form.
It requires all dependencies to be wired at construction time,
which usually leads to immutable wiring.
Setter injection is more flexible as wiring can be changed afterwards,
but could lead to problems where not all dependencies have been fully configured yet.
Interface injection is more complex, and is mainly useful if bidirectional links between dependencies and dependents need to be configured.</p>

          <p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></p>

          <p>To end this section, we summarize the main <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/the-6-benefits-of-dependency-injection-7802b207ec69">advantages</a>
and <a href="https://www.professionalqa.com/dependency-injection">disadvantages</a> of DI.</p>

          <p>Advantages:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Classes are loosely coupled, which leads to <strong>lower maintenance</strong> effort.</li>
            <li>Loose coupling also leads to better <strong>testability</strong>, as dependencies with lightweight interfaces can easily be mocked.</li>
            <li>Classes have a single responsibility, which leads to <strong>better understandable</strong> code.</li>
            <li>Applications are more <strong>flexible</strong>, as they can be wired differently by changing a configuration file.</li>
            <li>Applications are more <strong>extensible</strong>, as different interface implementations can be created, and swapped in or out easily.</li>
            <li>Since classes are coded against interfaces of dependencies, they lead to more <strong>independent</strong> code, which is beneficial in large teams that work in parallel.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Disadvantages:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Defining the wiring of an application via <strong>configurations can be complex</strong>, so good defaults must be available.</li>
            <li>Logic <strong>flow is harder to follow</strong> when debugging, which leads to the need of good documentation.</li>
            <li>DI frameworks can lead to <strong>overhead</strong> in terms of understandability, execution time and software size.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="related-work-software-description">Semantic Software Description</h3>

          <p>Configuration-based DI frameworks make use of some form of software description.
Therefore, we introduce the related work around semantic software descriptions.</p>

          <p>Software can be described on several levels of granularity,
going from a high-level package overview to a low-level description of the actual code.
The Software Ontology (SWO) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span> and <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap">Description of a Project (DOAP)</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span> ontology focus on the high-level management of software development,
enabling the description of tools, resources, contributors and tasks. 
At a slightly lower level, SWO includes interfaces, algorithms, versions, and the associated provenance data, but does not reach the level of detail to describe operational code.</p>

          <p>Ontologies that describe software configuration from a research workflow perspective are <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2814864.2814882"><a href="http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2015/SEMANTICS_LDWPO/public.pdf">LODFlow</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>, <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2015.01.003"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2015.01.003">Workflow-Centric Research Objects</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span> with the <cite><a href="https://w3id.org/ro/">Wf4Ever Research Object Model</a></cite> and the <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/escience.2014.47"><a href="http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/%7Emayer/publications/pdf/may_escience14.pdf">Ontologies for Describing the Context of Scientific Experiment Processes</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-11">11</a>]</span> with the <cite><a href="http://www.timbusproject.net/portal/publications/ontologies/">TIMBUS Context Model</a></cite> to compliment the Research Objects model. 
From a more generic perspective, there exist the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV Ontology</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</span>, the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority" href="http://www.opmw.org/model/OPMW/">OPMW-PROV Ontology</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</span>, and the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority" href="http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery.html">DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-14">14</a>]</span>.
However, these efforts can only cover (parts of) the connection between research and software, which is insufficient for dependency injection.
Such descriptions are however interpretive in that any given tool is subject to having multiple descriptions by different users.
In contrast to the human-driven descriptions, our work both enables and accelerates the generation of machine-driven Linked Data descriptions of software modules, their components, as well as their configurations to be uniformly created.
Consequently, this makes it possible to accurately describe and instantiate software experiments that can be reused and compared with unambiguously.</p>

          <p>Much more low-level and exact is the Core Software Ontology (CSO) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-15">15</a>]</span>,
which provides a foundational vocabulary that is designed for extensibility.
This includes the distinctive concepts to describe software as code, software as object to computational hardware, and software as a running computational activity,
but also Interfaces, Classes, Methods, the relationships between them, and workflow information on their invocation.
Its extension, the Core Ontology of Software Components (COSC), moves closer to the topic of this article by describing interfaces and protocols of objects.
Similar in scope is the Software Engineering Ontology Network (SEON) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-16">16</a>]</span>, which consolidates multiple ontologies for the Software Engineering field.
It includes a higher Core and Foundational layer, as well as multiple domain-specific ontologies.
Of particular interest is their Software Ontology (SwO) that captures the different artifacts in software.
In general, both ontologies (or suites) view software from a <q>network of communicating concepts</q> perspective.
This allows for exhaustive descriptions of complex software systems, but is not suited for describing class instances or aspects of modular programming (e.g., package dependencies).</p>

          <h3 id="related-work-di-frameworks">Dependency Injection Frameworks</h3>

          <p>The large spectrum of existing dependency injection frameworks indicates a high demand for such systems.
Java likely contains the largest collection of dependency injection frameworks.
Much of this stems from the strict typing,
which makes it difficult to create mock objects when required for testing
if the dependencies are nested in the implementation.</p>

          <p>One of the biggest Java frameworks is <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a>,
which amongst many things, also provides dependency injection.
That is one of its advantages though:
many projects already use Spring for other reasons,
reducing the jump required to add the dependency injection framework.
It supports two ways to do the injection.
The first one is through an external XML configuration file
which defines all the classes and how they are linked together.
The other one is with annotations in the actual code
that define how the interlinking of classes should work.
Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a> is a more lightweight alternative to Spring;
<a href="https://github.com/google/dagger">Dagger</a> was created to be even more lightweight than Guice.</p>

          <p>In JavaScript, 
dependency injection frameworks tend to be less common because of its flexible nature.
However, with the increasing popularity of TypeScript –which provides strict typings for JavaScript–,
the need for dependency injection is increasing.
Still, multiple frameworks are available, such as <a href="https://github.com/young-steveo/bottlejs">BottleJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cujojs/wire">Wire</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jaredhanson/electrolyte">Electrolyte</a>, all backed by rather small communities.
One of the biggest ones, <a href="https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS">InversifyJS</a>,
uses annotations similar to Java frameworks to define possible injections.
Unlike standard JavaScript,
it requires you to define interfaces and types via TypeScript,
thereby allowing it to make use of this extra information to correctly handle the linking.
Like Guice, it also has a bindings file to link classes to interfaces.</p>

          <p>Components.js differs from most of the aforementioned frameworks on different aspects,
of which the first one is unique to Components.js:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>RDF-based configuration files in order to make them globally <em>interoperable</em>, <em>addressable</em>, and <em>discoverable</em>.</li>
            <li>Decoupling of the dependency injection layer from the software implementation via separate configuration files.</li>
          </ul>

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
          <h2 property="schema:name">Declarative Configurations</h2>

          <p>Components.js depends on two levels of configuration for enabling the wiring of software components.
The first level is the creation of <em>components</em> files,
which are the semantic representation of component (or class) constructors,
and can usually be automatically generated.
The second level is the creation of <em>configuration</em> files,
which represent the actual instantiation of components
based on the generated components files.</p>

          <p>In this section, we discuss the two main vocabularies that are used within these component files,
and show how configuration files can refer to them for instantiation.
Next, we explain how URLs can be minted for software components, so that they become fully dereferenceable.
Finally, we explain how these component files can be generated automatically from existing TypeScript code.</p>

          <h3 id="object-oriented-components-vocabulary">Object-Oriented Components Vocabulary</h3>

          <p>Components.js distinguishes between three main concepts:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Module</dt>
            <dd>a software package containing zero or more components. This is equivalent to a Node module or npm package.</dd>
            <dt>Component</dt>
            <dd>a class that can be instantiated by creating a new instance of that type with zero or more parameter values. Parameters are defined by the class constructor.</dd>
            <dt>Configuration</dt>
            <dd>a semantic representation of an instantiation of a component into an object instance based on parameters.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>These concepts are described in the programming language independent <a href="https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/vocabularies/object-oriented"><em>Object-Oriented Components vocabulary (OO)</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>.
This vocabulary enables software components to be instantiated based on certain parameters,
analog to constructor arguments in object-oriented programming.
This is interpreted in the broad sense: only <em>classes</em>, <em>objects</em> and <em>constructor parameters</em> are considered.
An overview is given in <a href="#voc-oo-diagram">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

Within object-oriented languages, this can correspond to for example a software library or an application.
A component is typed as <code>oo:Component</code>, which is a <em>subclass</em> of <code>rdfs:Class</code>.
The parameters to construct the component can therefore be defined as an <code>rdfs:Property</code> on a component.</p>

          <p>We illustrate the usage of this vocabulary with an example in <a href="#module-oo">Listing 1</a> using the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-17">17</a>]</span> serialization.
This listing shows the definition of a new module (<code>oo:Module</code>) with compact IRI <code>ex:MyModule</code>.
The name of the module is set with the compact IRI <code>requireName</code>, which expands to <code>doap:name</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/ewilderj/doap/wiki">Description of a Project (DOAP) vocabulary</a>.
Furthermore, our module contains a single class component (<code>oo:Class</code>) with compact IRI <code>ex:MyModule/MyComponent</code>.
Since this is a class component (subclass of <code>oo:Component</code>), this means that this component is instantiatable based on parameters.
Each component can refer to its path within a module using the <code>oo:componentPath</code> predicate (compacted as <code>requireElement</code>).
Finally, our single component has a parameter (<code>oo:Parameter</code>) with compact IRI <code>ex:MyModule/MyComponent#name</code>
that can be set when instantiating this component.</p>

          <p>Since components and parameters are defined as RDFS vocabulary,
we can instantiate components easily using the <code>rdf:type</code> predicate,
and by using parameters as predicates on such new instances, as shown in <a href="#instance-oo">Listing 2</a>.
Instead of passing literals as values to parameters, it is also possible to pass <em>other component instances</em> as values,
thereby allowing nested component instantiations to be defined.</p>

          <h3 id="object-mapping-vocabulary">Object Mapping Vocabulary</h3>

          <p>As shown in the previous section, the OO vocabulary allows modules, components, and parameters to be defined,
so that instances of components can be declared.
However, this vocabulary only defines parameter values for component instances,
but it does not define how these parameter values are used to invoke the constructor of this component.
To enable this, we introduce the accompanying <a href="https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/vocabularies/object-mapping" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/​vocabularies/​object-​mapping"><em>Object Mapping vocabulary (OM)</em></a>.
<a href="#voc-om-diagram">Fig. 2</a> shows an overview of all its classes and predicates.</p>

            </figcaption>
</figure>

          <p>The OM vocabulary makes use of the <code>oo:constructorArguments</code> predicate for the domain <code>oo:Class</code>,
and thereby builds upon the OO vocabulary via the <code>oo:constructorArguments</code> extension point to define the class constructor’s behaviour.
Concretely, this new vocabulary defines a mapping between the component parameters as defined using the OO vocabulary,
and the raw objects that are passed into the constructor during instantiation.</p>

          <p>In essence, this vocabulary enables an (RDF list) of <code>om:ObjectMapping</code>’s to be passed to the <code>oo:constructorArguments</code> of an <code>oo:Class</code>.
An <code>om:ObjectMapping</code> represents an object containing zero or more key-value pairs, which are represented by <code>om:ObjectMappingEntry</code>.
<code>om:ArrayMapping</code> is a special type of <code>om:ObjectMapping</code> that represents an array, where its elements can be other <code>om:ObjectMapping</code>’s.</p>

            </figcaption>
</figure>

          <p>Building upon the OO example from <a href="#module-om">Listing 3</a>, we illustrate the usage of this vocabulary with an example in <a href="#module-om">Listing 3</a>, again using the JSON-LD serialization.
The only difference with the previous example, is the addition of the <code>constructorArguments</code> block,
which expands to <code>oo:constructorArguments</code> that is configured to always contain an RDF list.
The constructor arguments contain a single <code>om:ObjectMapping</code>, which is implied by the presence of <code>field</code>, which expands to <code>om:field</code>.
Since the field array contains just a single element (<code>om:ObjectMappingEntry</code>),
it represents an object with a single key and value.
The key is defined by <code>keyRaw</code> (expands to <code>om:fieldName</code>), which contains the constant <code>name</code>.
The value is defined by <code>value</code> (expands to <code>om:fieldValue</code>), which refers to the <code>ex:MyModule/MyComponent#name</code> parameter.</p>

          <p>The addition of an object mapping to a component requires no changes as to how a component is instantiated,
which means that our component from <a href="#module-om">Listing 3</a> can still be instantiated in the exact same way as the one from <a href="#module-oo">Listing 1</a>.
The only difference now, is that we are able to determine how exactly the parameter values are to be used for invoking the component constructor.
For example, the instantiation of <a href="#instance-oo">Listing 2</a> corresponds to the following code in JavaScript: <code>new MyComponent({ name: 'Some name' })</code></p>

          <h3 id="dereferenceability">Dereferenceability</h3>

this LSD service provides Linked Data subject pages for <em>all</em> packages within the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​www.npmjs.com/​">npm package manager</a> for JavaScript.
For example, the URL <a href="https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/core/1.21.1"><code>https:/​/​linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/core/1.21.1</code></a>

          <p>This LSD service allows creators of components files to mint LSD-based URLs for their packages,
which will automatically become dereferenceable as soon as these packages are published to npm.
The LSD service thereby removes the dereferenceability responsibility from package developers that want to use dependency injection via Components.js.</p>

          <h3 id="generation-from-typescript">Generation from TypeScript</h3>

          <p>For larger projects, the manual creation of components files for all classes in the project can require significant manual effort, and can therefore become error-prone.
For projects that make use of a strongly-typed language, such as TypeScript,
all required information to create such components files is in fact already available implicitly via the source code files.
In order to minimize manual effort for such projects, we provide the open-source tool <a href="https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components-Generator.js/" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​github.com/​LinkedSoftwareDependencies/​Components-​Generator.js/​"><em>Components-Generator.js</em></a> for TypeScript projects.</p>

          <p>Concretely, this tool can be installed into any TypeScript project.
When its command-line script is invoked, it scans all exported TypeScript classes within this project,
and generates corresponding components files for them.
In doing so, it preserves information that is important for dependency injection,
such as component extensions via class inheritance relationships and
parameter types with constructor arguments mapping via class constructors.</p>

          <p>For example, assuming an npm package named <code>my-package</code> containing the single TypeScript class from <a href="#generator-ts">Listing 5</a>,
Components-Generator.js will generate the components file in <a href="#generator-out">Listing 6</a>.</p>

          <h2 property="schema:name">Dependency Injection Framework</h2>

          <p>Building on top of the declarative configurations that were explained in previous section,
we now discuss Components.js, which is a system that can interpret these configurations
for enabling dependency injection within JavaScript/TypeScript projects.
In this section, we first explain the main architecture, followed by the most relevant implementation details.</p>

          <h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>

          <p>Internally, the Components.js dependency injection tool goes through three main phases:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Loading: Initialization of DI components, discovery of modules, and loading of configuration files.</li>
            <li>Preprocessing: Handling of constructor arguments before construction.</li>
            <li>Construction: Instantiation of JavaScript classes based on configuration files.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These three phases are handled by the <code>ComponentsManager</code>,
which acts as the main entrypoint of the framework
as can be seen in <a href="#architecture-main">Fig. 3</a>
This manager class is constructed via a static <code>build</code> method,
via which custom options can be passed,
such as a callback for loading modules and configuration files.</p>

          <p>For the sake of clarity, all UML architecture diagrams that we include in this article
only contain simplified representations of the actual classes.
So there may be minor differences when comparing the diagrams with the actual source code.</p>

          <figure id="architecture-main">
<img src="img/architecture-main.svg" alt="[Components.js Architecture - Main package]" />
<figcaption>
              <p><span class="label">Fig. 3:</span> UML diagram of the classes within the main package,
which contains the main entrypoint of the framework.</p>
            </figcaption>
</figure>

          <p>Hereafter, we explain these three phases in more detail.</p>

          <h4 id="loading">Loading</h4>

          <p>When the <code>ComponentsManager</code> is being built,
the loading phase will be initiated,
which will make use of the classes within the load package.
The most important classes within this package are shown in <a href="#architecture-load">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

          <figure id="architecture-load">
<img src="img/architecture-load.svg" alt="[Components.js Architecture - Load package]" />
<figcaption>
              <p><span class="label">Fig. 4:</span> UML diagram of the classes within the load package,
which are responsible for loading components and configurations.</p>
            </figcaption>
</figure>

          <p>The <code>ModuleStateBuilder</code> is a class that is responsible for scanning the current JavaScript project and its dependencies.
The main objective of this class is to build an <code>IModuleState</code>, that contains information such as the paths to available components and dependencies.</p>

          <p><code>ComponentRegistry</code> and <code>ConfigRegistry</code> are classes that are exposed via a callback to invokers of <code>ComponentsManager.build()</code>.
These classes respectively enable modules and configurations to be registered,
after they will be loaded.</p>

          <h4 id="preprocessing">Preprocessing</h4>

          <p>Before a configuration is instantiated during the construction phase,
it always goes through a preprocessing phase.
Concretely, this involves processing all parameters and constructor arguments,
for which the most relevant classes and interfaces are shown in <a href="#architecture-preprocess">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

          <figure id="architecture-preprocess">
<img src="img/architecture-preprocess.svg" alt="[Components.js Architecture - Preprocess package]" />
<figcaption>
              <p><span class="label">Fig. 5:</span> UML diagram of the classes within the preprocess package,
which are responsible for preprocessing config parameters and constructor arguments.</p>
            </figcaption>
</figure>

          <p><code>IConfigPreprocessor</code> is an interface that represents a preprocessing algorithm for a configuration,
and can have multiple implementations.</p>

          <p><code>ConfigPreprocessorComponent</code> is a preprocessor that is able to determine what component is being instantiated within a configuration.
It will check if the linked component exists, and it will validate all passed parameters.
For this parameter validation, the <code>ParameterHandler</code> class is used,
which works based on a list of <code>IParameterPropertyHandler</code>’s.
For instance, parameter property handlers exist for validating the range of parameters,
checking the uniqueness, handling default values, and more.</p>

          <p><code>ConfigPreprocessorComponentMapped</code> is another preprocessor that builds upon <code>ConfigPreprocessorComponent</code>,
so that it <em>additionally</em> handles constructor arguments as defined by the Object Mapping vocabulary.
Concretely, after validating parameters, it will handle the constructor arguments recursively
using a list of <code>IConstructorArgumentsElementMappingHandler</code>’s.
These handlers can handle specific types of constructor arguments and parameters,
such as the conversion of <code>om:ObjectMapping</code> to an object,
and the conversion of <code>om:ArrayMapping</code> to an array.</p>

          <p>The end-result of the preprocessing phase is a configuration that represents
the raw constructor call of a class, together with the required arguments.</p>

          <h4 id="construction">Construction</h4>

          <p>The construction phase is responsible for instantiating a configuration.
The main classes for this are shown in <a href="#architecture-construct">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

          <figure id="architecture-construct">
<img src="img/architecture-construct.svg" alt="[Components.js Architecture - Construct package]" />
<figcaption>
              <p><span class="label">Fig. 6:</span> UML diagram of the classes within the construct package,
which are responsible for instantiating configs according to a certain strategy.</p>
            </figcaption>
</figure>

          <p><code>ConfigConstructorPool</code> is the main entrypoint that is used when a user instantiates a configuration via <code>ComponentsManager.instantiate()</code>.
Before actually instantiating a config,
it will first check if it had been instantiated before,
in which case it returns it from a cache.
This may occur for nested configurations that reuse the same component in different places.
If the config has not been instantiated before,
it will first go through the preprocessing phase as explained in the previous section,
after the processed config will be passed on to the <code>ConfigConstructor</code>.</p>

          <p>The <code>ConfigConstructor</code> is able to convert the representation of a class constructor call into an actual constructor call to obtain an object.
For this, the arguments of the constructor are first converted into actual objects,
which is done via a list of <code>IArgumentConstructorHandler</code>’s.
For example, handlers exist to handle primitive values such as strings and numbers,
arrays, and references to other components (which requires a recursive call to <code>ConfigConstructorPool</code>).
Once the arguments have been resolved, the constructor can be applied to obtain the final instantiated object.</p>

          <p>By default, the <code>ConfigConstructor</code> assumes that configurations are instantiated via the <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html">CommonJS JavaScript standard</a>,
which is primarily used by the Node.js framework.
However, Components.js has been designed to handle different kinds of instantiation,
which can be done via different <code>IConstructionStrategy</code>’s.
For instance, this allows the framework to be compatible with other upcoming JavaScript standards such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">JavaScript modules</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

          <p>Components.js has been implemented in TypeScript,
and is available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components.js">https:/​/​github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components.js</a>)
under the MIT license.
At the time of writing, the latest release is at version 4.4.1,
which is published via the npm package manager (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/componentsjs">https:/​/​www.npmjs.com/package/componentsjs</a>).</p>

          <p>Due to the critical nature of this framework,
it is being tested thoroughly.
At the time of writing, it consists of 538 unit tests,
which reach a test coverage of 100%.</p>

          <p>Components.js is being maintained by IDLab via software projects that make use of this framework.
A sustainability of this project is available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components.js/wiki/Sustainability-Plan">https:/​/​github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components.js/wiki/Sustainability-Plan</a>).</p>

          <p>Finally, in-depth documentation is available (<a href="https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https:/​/​componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>),
which explains how to create component and configuration files,
and how to invoke the DI tool.</p>

  <section id="usage" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#usage">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
          <h2 property="schema:name">Usage</h2>

          <p>The usage of an open-source project without the use of any tracking software is a picture that is always incomplete.
Nevertheless, we analyze the usage of Components.js in this section on two aspects:
empirical usage via available metrics, and in-use analysis of specific projects.
We discuss these two aspects hereafter.</p>

          <h3 id="usage-metrics">Usage Metrics</h3>

          <p>As the source code of Components.js is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components.js" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​github.com/​LinkedSoftwareDependencies/​Components.js">GitHub</a>,
it is possible to inspect the usage of this project within other projects hosted on GitHub.
As of August 2 2021, there are 9 GitHub projects that depend on Components.js directly, and 268 that depend on it indirectly via transitive dependencies.
This shows that Components.js is primarily used as a core library to support larger projects that have a broad usage.</p>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/componentsjs" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​www.npmjs.com/​package/​componentsjs">npm package manager</a> from which Components.js can be installed offers us additional insights.
For the week of July 26 2021 until August 1 2021 there were 5.351 downloads, which is an average number when comparing it to previous weeks.
However, there are outliers that have weekly downloads peak up to around 200.000 downloads.</p>

          <p>While these GitHub and npm metrics give us <em>some</em> insight into the usage of Components.js,
they are incomplete, as projects may be hosted on other source code platforms such as GitLab, Bitbucket, or even private instances.
Furthermore, direct downloads from npm are also incomplete, as downstream users may use bundling tools such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>
to incorporate the Components.js source code directly within their library, which makes downloads of that library not go via the the Components.js npm package anymore.
Therefore, we conclude that the metrics reported here are merely a lower limit,
and the actual usage is expected to be higher.</p>

          <h3 id="in-use-analysis">In-use Analysis</h3>

          <p>In the previous section, we provided an informed estimate as to <em>how much</em> Components.js is being used.
In this section, we provide an analysis of <em>in what way</em> Components.js is being used in four real-world projects:
Solid Community Server, Handlers.js, Digita Identity Proxy, and Comunica.</p>

          <h4 id="solid-community-server">Solid Community Server</h4>

          <p>The Solid Community Server (<a href="https://github.com/solid/community-server/">https:/​/​github.com/solid/community-server/</a>)
is a server-side implementation of the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://solid.github.io/specification/">Solid specifications</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-18">18</a>]</span>,
which provides a basis for the Solid decentralization effort.
When such a server is hosted, it allows users to create their own personal storage space (pod) and identity,
so that this data can be used within any external Solid application.
This server is written in TypeScript, and is being developed by <a href="https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt</a> and <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en">imec</a>,
which includes authors of this article.</p>

          <p>This server makes use of dependency injection because a primary goal of the server is to be as flexible as possible,
so that developers can easily modify the capabilities of the server, or even add additional capabilities.
This is especially useful in the context of research, where new components can be added to the server for experimentation,
before they are standardized and become a part of the Solid specifications.
To enable this level of flexibility, all components within this server are loosely coupled,
and are wired via customizable Components.js configuration files.</p>

          <p>Since the Solid Community Server makes use of TypeScript, it is able to make use of the Components-Generator.js tool as explained before in <a href="#configs">Section 3</a>,
which avoids the need to manually create components files, and thereby significantly simplifies the usage of Components.js within this project.
At the time of writing, this server contains 246 components that can be customized via specific parameters, and wired together to form a server instance with specific capabilities.</p>

          <h4 id="handlersjs">Handlers.js</h4>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/digita-ai/handlersjs" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​github.com/​digita-​ai/​handlersjs">Handlers.js</a> aims to provide a comprehensive collection of generic logic classes,
that can be wired together via the composition pattern.
While this project is still under development, it already provides numerous handlers and services pertaining to
data flows, storage, logging, error handling, as well as logic about serving data over HTTP (routing, CORS, content negotiation …).
This project is written in TypeScript, and is being developed by <a href="https://www.digita.ai/">Digita</a>.</p>

          <p>In contrast to the Solid Community Server, Handlers.js is not meant to be usable by itself as standalone tool.
Instead, it is an accompanying library that can be used by other tools.
The components within Handlers.js are meant to capture common patterns within projects that depend on composition-based components,
so that they can be reused by other projects that make use of DI frameworks such as Components.js.
While Components.js is the primary DI framework this library was designed for,
it does not strictly depend on it thanks to the loosely coupling of the Components.js DI layer and software implementations.</p>

          <p>Handlers.js also make use of the Components-Generator.js tool to convert TypeScript classes into components files.
At the time of writing, this project exposes 40 components that range from abstract logic flows to specific ones for setting up a simple HTTP server.
Since components within Components.js have global semantics, these components can be easily reused across projects.</p>

          <h4 id="digita-identity-proxy">Digita Identity Proxy</h4>

          <p>The Digita Identity Proxy (not public at the time of writing) is a <a href="https://solid.github.io/authentication-panel/solid-oidc/" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​solid.github.io/​authentication-​panel/​solid-​oidc/​">Solid-OIDC</a>-compliant proxy server
that acts as a modular, and easily configurable compatibility layer for classic <a href="https://openid.net/connect/" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​openid.net/​connect/​">OIDC</a> Identity Providers.
It enables Solid apps to authenticate at Solid pod servers with these existing identity services, without any necessary modification.
This project is also written in TypeScript, and is under development by <a href="https://www.digita.ai/">Digita</a>.</p>

          <p>Several components exists that enable additional functionality of Solid-OIDC,
which can be plugged into the proxy when the need exists.
With Components.js, these components can be easily configured and plugged in via a configuration file.</p>

          <h4 id="comunica">Comunica</h4>

          <p><a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://comunica.github.io/Article-ISWC2018-Resource/">Comunica</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span> is another project that makes use of Components.js at its core.
Comunica is a highly modular SPARQL query engine
that has been designed to be a flexible research platform for SPARQL query execution.
It has been written in TypeScript, and is developed by Ghent University, by authors of this article.</p>

          <p>The modular nature of Comunica calls for a dependency injection framework due to its <a href="https://comunica.dev/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/">actor-mediator-bus paradigm</a>.
All logic within Comunica is placed within small actors,
which are registered on task-specific buses following the publish-subscribe pattern.
In order to select a certain actor on a bus for achieving a certain task,
the mediator pattern is applied, which allows different actors to be selected based on different actions.
These actors, buses, and mediators are loosely coupled with each other,
and are wired together via Components.js configuration files.
For example, this allows users of Comunica to create and plug in a different algorithm for resolving a certain SPARQL query operator.</p>

          <p>At the time of writing, Comunica does not yet make use of the Components-Generator.js tool,
as it was developed before Components-Generator.js was created.
Therefore, all components files within Comunica are created manually,
which shows that Components.js is flexible in this regard.</p>

          <p>As Comunica is a research platform for research around query execution,
the ability to <em>reproduce</em> experiments is crucial.
This is where the benefit of Components.js becomes especially apparent.
It is often the case that research articles with experimental results only report on the used software,
without mentioning the exact version and configuration that was used.
When using a Components.js configuration file,
the necessary semantics for accurately replicating such experiments are available as Linked Data.
The reproducibility of <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://git.its.aau.dk/CLAAUDIA/teach_reproducibility/raw/commit/dbea465c0d10bca50b0cca23fd93afd0ffea08dc/litt/Wavelab%20and%20reproducible%20research.pdf">experimental results is often considered to be even more important than the research article itself</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-19">19</a>]</span>,
as the article can be considered to be merely <em>advertising of the scholarship</em>.</p>

          <h2 property="schema:name">Conclusions</h2>

          <p>After more than four years of development, Components.js has become a stable Dependency Injection framework for TypeScript and JavaScript projects,
and has seen a significant uptake by popular tools that make use of it as core technology.
It has been shown to be useful for enabling the primary tasks of a DI framework,
but thanks to its semantic configuration files,
it also brings with it the power of Linked Data and the Semantic Web for enabling globally interoperable and discoverable configurations.
Using the Linked Software Dependencies service, components and configurations become dereferenceable and citable,
which allows software configurations to be shared easily with others,
which is for example beneficial for improving the reproducibility of software experiments.</p>

          <p>The previous section has shown that Components.js provides significant value in real-world applications.
On the one hand, tools such as Solid Community Server and Comunica allow developers and researchers to rewire these applications based on their specific needs.
On the other hand, applications by companies such as Digita depend on this flexibility for making logic changes via configuration files,
as they want to enable their clients to make changes by only modifying the configuration files,
since their clients are sometimes non-technical people that have limited programming knowledge.</p>

          <p>We can recommend Components.js for TypeScript/JavaScript projects that have at least a subset of the following characteristics:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Architectures that require <strong>high modularity and flexibility</strong>;</li>
            <li>Need to modify wiring of components <strong>without changing code</strong>;</li>
            <li>Need for ability to <strong>share wiring configurations</strong> with others;</li>
            <li>Managing and including <strong>configurations across different projects</strong>;</li>
            <li>Using <strong>configurations in other contexts</strong>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As with all DI frameworks, Components.js comes with the downside that for large applications,
configurations can become complex and logic flow may be harder to follow.
In order to mitigate these risks, we recommend a structured management of configuration files,
which may involve splitting up configuration files based on your architecture’s primary subsystems,
which is the approach followed by large projects such as Solid Community Server and Comunica.</p>

          <p>In future work, we do not foresee the need for any major changes or additions within the Components.js framework itself,
aside from keeping up with new language features from JavaScript and TypeScript.
However, all large projects that make use of Components.js have identified the need for better tooling to create and manage configuration files.
For example, the Comunica project is developing a <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica-packager" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​github.com/​comunica/​comunica-​packager">graphical user interface</a>
to visually customize the wiring of the engine, which can then be exported into a reusable configuration file.
Since Components.js configurations make use of the Linked Data principles,
it is possible to create a generic user interface to create such configuration files for any project that makes use of Components.js.
Furthermore, since components and configuration files are largely programming language-independent,
it is possible to create equivalent implementations of Components.js for other OO languages such as Java and C#.</p>

          <p>In general, Components.js gives us the necessary foundation for building next-level applications that depend on high flexiblity, such as smart agents.
These applications are crucial for environments such as Linked Data and the Semantic Web,
which require and benefit from this level of flexibility.
Therefore, DI frameworks such as Components.js pave the road towards a world with more flexible applications.</p>
